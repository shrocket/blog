pageTitle: draft (jay's fish)
---

At the end of the play, the Jay character, who has not spoken a single word the entire play (or at least not in the Jay sections), removes a fish from a bowl that has been on stage for the entire play, and places the fish on the floor. Holding the dripping net in his hand, he looks at the audience.

Is is an act of murder or mercy?

We named the fish Rocinante.

Some member of the audience saved the fish every single performance.

To this day, I do not know if Jay would have, after some internally decided upon period of time, saved the fish himself. I would not have.
