## What is this?

I keep creating blogs because I guess I think I have something to say. This is technically still the previous blog I created; I've just moved it from wordpress.com to this site where I have complete control over the look and feel of things (as well, more importantly, as the content), but if we count both hosts and names, well:

1. _rocket to nowhere_ on blogger
2. _rocket to nowhere_ at rocket2nowhere.com (wordpress self-hosted)
3. [rocket2nowhere.tumblr.com](https://rocket2nowhere.tumblr.com)
4. [mycompost.tumblr.com](https://mycompost.tumblr.com)
5. _any minor world that breaks apart comes together again_ at wordpress.com
6. _any minor world that breaks apart comes together again_ at this site, written in markdown and published with [11ty](http://www.11ty.dev)

## Why do I keep making blogs?

If you're curious as to why I keep doing this, have a look at the about page; I think I try to answer "why?" there.

## What is this going to be?

I'll start with what this is not going to be. This is not going to be monetized. This is not going to be single-theme. This is not going to be coherent.

This is going to be whatever I want it to be. It's going to be random. It's going to be stupid. It's going to be cheap. It's going to be shitty. Stick around anyway.

Maybe at some point, I'll add a way for you to subscribe.
