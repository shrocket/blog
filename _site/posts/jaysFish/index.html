        <h1>draft (jay's fish)</h1>
        <p>2025 July 19 - 22:29</p></br>
        <p>At the end of the play, the Jay character, who has not spoken a single word the entire play (or at least not in the Jay sections), removes a fish from a bowl that has been on stage for the entire play, and places the fish on the floor. Holding the dripping net in his hand, he looks at the audience.</p>
<p>Is is an act of murder or mercy?</p>
<p>We named the fish Rocinante.</p>
<p>Some member of the audience saved the fish every single performance.</p>
<p>To this day, I do not know if Jay would have, after some internally decided upon period of time, saved the fish himself. I would not have.</p>
