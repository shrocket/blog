        <h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>I keep creating blogs because I guess I think I have something to say. This is technically still the previous blog I created; I've just moved it from wordpress.com to this site where I have complete control over the look and feel of things (as well, more importantly, as the content), but if we count both hosts and names, well:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>rocket to nowhere</em> on blogger</li>
<li><em>rocket to nowhere</em> at rocket2nowhere.com (wordpress self-hosted)</li>
<li><a href="https://rocket2nowhere.tumblr.com">rocket2nowhere.tumblr.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mycompost.tumblr.com">mycompost.tumblr.com</a></li>
<li><em>any minor world that breaks apart comes together again</em> at wordpress.com</li>
<li><em>any minor world that breaks apart comes together again</em> at this site, written in markdown and published with <a href="http://www.11ty.dev">11ty</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>Why do I keep making blogs?</h2>
<p>If you're curious as to why I keep doing this, have a look at the about page; I think I try to answer &quot;why?&quot; there.</p>
<h2>What is this going to be?</h2>
<p>I'll start with what this is not going to be. This is not going to be monetized. This is not going to be single-theme. This is not going to be coherent.</p>
<p>This is going to be whatever I want it to be. It's going to be random. It's going to be stupid. It's going to be cheap. It's going to be shitty. Stick around anyway.</p>
<p>Maybe at some point, I'll add a way for you to subscribe. Or even some CSS!</p>
