<p>I'll be damned if I know what this is. It's 2025, and blogs seem to go in and out of style. For ten-plus years, I wrote a blog called <em>rocket to nowhere</em>. It got hacked by some weird phrama thing, and blogs were out of style, and I thought maybe I should do something else somewhere else, and, in that atmosphere, it was easier to kill that blog than try to fix it. I had &quot;social media&quot; for a while. I suppose I still do, but I also like having a place to put words and ideas and photographs online that isn't &quot;social media.&quot; Also, when I was unempployed for a year, I did a front-end web development boot camp, and so I also like the idea of having a place on the internet over which I am more or less in complete control.</p>
